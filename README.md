## Abstract

Machine learning-based (ML) systems are becoming the primary means of achieving the highest levels of productivity and effectiveness. Incorporating other advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), or e-Health systems, has made ML the first choice to help automate systems and predict future events. The execution environment of ML is always presenting contrasting types of threats, such as adversarial poisoning of training datasets or model parameters manipulation. Blockchain technology is known as a decentralized network of blocks that symbolizes means of protecting block content integrity and ensuring secure execution of operations.Existing studies partially incorporated Blockchain into the learning process. This paper proposes a more extensive secure way to protect the decision process of the learning model. Using smart contracts, this study executed the model’s decision by the reversal engineering of the learning model’s decision function from the extracted learning parameters. We deploy Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers decision functions on-chain for more comprehensive integration of Blockchain. The effectiveness of this proposed approach is measured by applying a case study of medical records. In a safe environment, SVM prediction scores were found to be higher than MLP. However, MLP had higher time efficiency.
